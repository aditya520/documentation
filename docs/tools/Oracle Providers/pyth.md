## Overview

The [Pyth network](https://pyth.network/) is the largest first-party financial oracle network, delivering real-time market data to over 40 blockchains securely and transparently.

The network comprises some of the world’s largest exchanges, market makers, and financial services providers, publishing proprietary price data on-chain for aggregation and distribution to smart contract applications.

## Using Pyth network
                                                                                       
The Pyth network introduces an innovative low-latency [pull oracle design](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/on-demand), where users can pull price updates on-chain when needed, enabling everyone in the blockchain environment to access that data point. 

Developers on Gnosis have permissionless access to any of Pyth’s 350+ price feeds for equities, ETFs, commodities, foreign exchange pairs, and cryptocurrencies.

Here is a working example of a contract that fetches the latest price on the Gnosis network. 
You have to pass [Pyth's contract address](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses/evm) for Gnosis mainnet/testnet(Chiado) and the desired [price feed ID](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) to fetch the latest price.

```solidity 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";

contract MyFirstPythContract {
    IPyth pyth;

    constructor(address _pyth) {
        pyth = IPyth(_pyth);
    }

    function fetchPrice(
        bytes[] calldata pythPriceUpdate,
        bytes32 priceFeed
    ) public payable returns (int64) {
        uint updateFee = pyth.getUpdateFee(pythPriceUpdate);
        pyth.updatePriceFeeds{value: updateFee}(pythPriceUpdate);

        // Fetch the latest price
        PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPrice(priceFeed);
        return price.price;
    }
}

```

Here you can fetch the `updateData` from our [`Hermes` feed](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/pythnet-price-feeds/hermes), which listens to Pythnet and Wormhole for price updates, or you can use the [`pyth-evm-js`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js/src/EvmPriceServiceConnection.ts#L15) SDK. 


This [package](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity) provides utilities for consuming prices from the Pyth network oracle using Solidity. Also, it contains the [Pyth Interface ABI](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity/abis/IPyth.json) that you can use in your libraries to communicate with the Pyth contract.

We recommend following the [consumer best practices](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/best-practices) when consuming Pyth data. 

For more information, check out the official [Pyth documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds). There are details on the various functions available for interacting with the Pyth smart contract in the [API Reference section](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-reference/evm).
